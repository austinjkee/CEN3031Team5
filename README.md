tutormatchingservice.com Features

We are developing features for Tutor-Matching Service

For now, we will be developing a feature:

A Dashboard for usage stats for individual users or groups of schools.

* GUI Stats/Maps for sign ups, metrics for how many users, who's using it, how are they using it, courses.
* GUI Stats/Maps about tutors, times available, primary mode of communication with users.
* GUI Stats about the schools involved.
* Goals: motivational billboard for employees, heuristics usable for gauging performance of Tutor-Matching Service
  >
  * Good appearance for the UI/UX
  * Customizability is a plus
* Single access code.
* Internal use for employees, but use APIs to grab data from webpage.
  >
  * API access by end of the week.
* Separate from the website, standalone application. (not JS?)
